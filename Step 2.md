After installing the AWS CLI, we recommend that you also configure it. For more information, see Quick configuration with aws configure in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.  
Run command  

```bash
aws configure
```
It will ask you  
a. Aws access key id  
b. Secret access key  
You can get these from security credential on aws portal.
